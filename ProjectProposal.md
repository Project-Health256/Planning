# Capstone Project Proposal

This exercise is designed to help you narrow the scope of your research down to a well-defined problem whose solution you can reasonably derive over the course of the next five to six weeks. 


## Project Health
* Jason Padilla
* Matthew Tan
  
## Research Area(s)
> _What technical topic(s) are you planning to explore through this project?_
* Nest.js
* React
* Three.js
* JWT
* CockroachDB Serverless
* Chart.js

## Problem Statement
 >_Young adults today have insecurities about their bodies. With the internet being a vast source of information, it overwhelms them. As a result, many go down an unfavorable path that tends to lead them to unwanted results. Through our web application, we will create a better alternative to navigating their weight journey._ 

## Proposed Solution
> _We plan to allow young adults to become knowledgeable about choosing the right path in their journey through a TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure). Furthermore, we want to become an acceptable and engaging source of information that not only piques interest; but also supports the users in wanting to continue their progression through additional information & resources._

## Anticipated Technical Challenges
> _What are the key technical challenges that your team will have to solve in order to ship this solution?_
* Learning new technologies
* Coming up with a permissible health approach
* Creating an equal balance between inviting yet user-friendly content

## Supporting Research
> _Please include hyperlinks to blogs, research papers, and books that have helped inform your opinion so far or those that you believe will guide your research?_
